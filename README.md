# Lab 8 - Unit & E2E Testing 
## Chris Kim (No Partners)

1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? 
   * Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
   * Manually run them locally before pushing code
   * Run them all after all development is completed

2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
> No. E2E would check the entire workflow and isn't suitable for checking a particular output. Unit testing would limit the scope and result faster testing, thus more appropriate.

3. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

4. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
